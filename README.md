This repository contains the necessary code to process GPX files stored in a Google Drive folder as input and show the GPX traces on an interactive map.

## Categories

When you upload your GPX file in the Google Drive, you need to properly name it, so that it is correctly colored on the website.

Indeed, the GPX traces are categorized into five categories:

- `parcours`: Files starting with "Parcours"
- `chemin_boueux`: Files containing "chemin" and "boueux"
- `chemin_inondable`: Files containing "chemin" and "inondable"
- `danger`: Files containing "danger"
- `autres`: Other files

The category is determined based on the GPX file name. Ensure the file name includes the category to map it correctly.

To add new categories, modify the `getCategory` function in the `scripts/process-gpx.js` file.
To update the effect of new categories on color and weight, modify the `getColor` and `getWeight` functions in the `scripts/map.js` file.
Also, do not forget to add it to the box selection in index.html if needed

## Documentation

The documentation for the codebase can be found under the `docs/` directory in the generated website: https://statnmap.github.io/gpx-traces-website/docs/
The documentation is generated using JSDoc.

## Directory Structure

- `scripts/`: Directory to store scripts.
- `tests/`: Directory to store unit tests.
- `test-gpx-files/`: Directory to store GPX files to be used for unit tests.
- `.github/workflows/`: Directory to store GitHub Actions workflows.

2. Ensure the GPX file name includes the category ("sec", "inonde", "boueux") to map it to the correct category.
3. Run the pre-build script to process the GPX files and update the JSON file:
   ```sh
   node scripts/process-gpx.js
   ```

## GitHub Actions and Deployment

The repository is configured to use GitHub Actions to build and deploy the website. The pre-build script is included in the build process to process the GPX files and update the JSON file whenever new GPX files are added or existing ones are modified.

The static website is hosted on GitHub Pages. The repository is configured to automatically build and deploy the website using GitHub Actions whenever changes are made to the GPX files or the codebase.

To add your current GPS position on the map when using a smartphone, follow these steps:

1. Open the website on your smartphone.
2. Click the "Add Current GPS Position" button.
3. Allow the website to access your location if prompted.
4. Your current GPS position will be added to the map with a marker.

## Trace Name

The trace name (`trace.name`) used in the application is derived from the GPX filename (without extension). Ensure the GPX filename is descriptive and includes the category to map it correctly.

## Running the Script Locally with Google Drive Credentials

To run the script locally while defining the `GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID` and `GOOGLE_DRIVE_CREDENTIALS` values during the Terminal session, follow these steps:

1. Open a Terminal session.
2. Install the required dependencies by running:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ``` 
3. Set the `GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID` environment variables by running:
   ```sh
   export GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID="your-folder-id"
   export GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID_TEST="your-test-folder-id"
   ```
   Replace `"your-folder-id"` with the actual folder ID from Google Drive.

4. Set the `GOOGLE_DRIVE_CREDENTIALS` environment variable by running:
   ```sh
   export GOOGLE_DRIVE_CREDENTIALS='{
     "type": "service_account",
     "project_id": "gpx-traces-website",
     "private_key_id": "your-private-key-id",
     "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
     "client_email": "your-client-email",
     "client_id": "your-client-id",
     "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
     "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
     "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
     "client_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/your-client-email"
   }'
   ```
   Replace the placeholders with the actual values from your `credentials.json` file.

5. Create the `credentials.json` file by running:
   ```sh
   echo '{
     "type": "service_account",
     "project_id": "gpx-traces-website",
     "private_key_id": "your-private-key-id",
     "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",

     "client_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/your-client-email"
   }' > credentials.json
   ```
   Replace the placeholders with the actual values from your `credentials.json` file.

6. Run the pre-processing script by executing:
   ```sh
   node scripts/run-process-gpx.js
   ```

This will process the GPX files from the specified Google Drive folder and update the `traces-real/traces.json` file.

7. Run build locally
```sh
npm run build
```

8. Run the local server
```sh
webpack serve
```
Stop the server by pressing `Ctrl + C` in the terminal.

## Creating GPX Files for Unit Tests and Storing Them on Google Drive

To create the correct GPX files for unit tests and store them manually on the proper Google Drive, follow these steps:

1. Create the GPX files with the required content. Ensure the file names include the category ("parcours", "chemin_boueux", "chemin_inondable", "danger", "autres") to map them correctly.
2. Store the gpx files in the "test-gpx-files/" directory to record changes
3. Upload the GPX files to the designated test folder on Google Drive.
4. Find the ID of the test folder on Google Drive by navigating to the folder and copying the long string of characters after `folders/` in the URL.
5. Create the `GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID_TEST` secret in your GitHub repository with the test folder ID as the value. Refer to the instructions in the `README.md` file for creating secrets.

## Code Quality and Style Enforcement

The project uses ESLint for code quality and style enforcement. ESLint helps to identify and fix problems in the JavaScript code, ensuring that the codebase follows consistent coding standards.

The project also uses Prettier for code formatting. Prettier automatically formats the code according to a set of predefined rules, making the code more readable and maintainable.

To run ESLint and Prettier, use the following commands:

```sh
npm run lint
npm run format
```

## JavaScript Transpilation

The project uses Babel for JavaScript transpilation. Babel allows the use of modern JavaScript features by converting the code into a compatible version that can run in older browsers.

The Babel configuration can be found in the `babel.config.json` file.

## Bundling

The project uses Webpack for bundling the JavaScript code and other assets. Webpack helps to optimize the code and manage dependencies, making the project more efficient and easier to maintain.

The Webpack configuration can be found in the `webpack.config.js` file.

## Generating Documentation

The project uses JSDoc to generate documentation for the JavaScript code. JSDoc allows you to document your code using comments, and then generate an HTML documentation report.

To generate the documentation, use the following command:

```sh
npm run generate-docs
```

The generated documentation will be available in the `out/` directory.

## Deploying Documentation

The GitHub Actions workflow is configured to generate and deploy the documentation to a sub-directory of the gh-pages branch during CI/CD. The documentation will be available at `https://statnmap.github.io/gpx-traces-website/docs/`.

## Simplifying GPX File Geometry

The code now includes a feature to simplify GPX file geometry while keeping one point every 10 meters. This helps reduce the size of GPX files and improve performance.

To achieve this, the `simplifyCoordinates` function was added to the `scripts/process-gpx.js` file. This function filters coordinates based on a 10-meter distance threshold.

The `getCoordinates` function in the `scripts/process-gpx.js` file was updated to use the `simplifyCoordinates` function.

Unit tests were added in the `tests/process-gpx.test.js` file to verify the simplification logic.

## Cron Job for Deploying Last Tagged Version

The deploy CI workflow now includes a cron job that deploys the last tagged version. The cron job is scheduled to run every Monday at 9 AM. This ensures that the latest tagged version is deployed to GitHub Pages on a regular basis. The cron job deploys the last tagged version only.
